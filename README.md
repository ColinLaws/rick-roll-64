# üéÆ RickRoll64 üï∫üèª

Hi there! I'm so glad you stopped by to check out my silly project.
All credit goes to the developers working to make libdragon a reality.
Please check out their open source project to learn more about building
your own ROM's for N64. Also, as a side-note, I don't own the rights
to the song of course, so just putting that out there.

## What tools did I use?

[UNFLoader](https://github.com/buu342/N64-UNFLoader)

[EverDrive64](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x7.html)

[AudioConv64](https://n64squid.com/homebrew/libdragon/dfs/audioconv64/)

[Minimalist GNU for Windows 64-bit (toolchain related)](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

I'm running on Windows and using VSCode as my IDE. I have set up build
commands that will let me push my ROM over to an EverDrive64 X7 over
USB. The tool I use for that is called UNFLoader. You should be able
to find some great help on using UNFLoader to send your roms over the
wire to your test cartridge.

With two monitors up, one for the 64 and one for my machine, I can hit
F5 on my keyboard to Run my code on the N64 natively. This is great,
because you wont run into any issues down the line with emulators not
being one-to-one with the real hardware.

Also again, this wouldn't be possible without the folks making libdragon.
Thanks to all of you, I couldn't have made this gem without you. Make
sure to check out their instructions on how to set up a docker container
for your build environment to make your life much easier.

## How to make a cartridge

[N64 Cartridge Shells](https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-cart-shell)

Check out the N64 Blaster sold by RETRO Stage at retrostage.net
I used the RetroBlaster to write my ROM file directly to a new
N64 Blaster board. These may be sold out for a little while, as
they're making a new one right now as of 11/30/2023.
